# news_app

A news fetching application built in Flutter. In this app, I have used NewsApi.org API service to get news data. Flutter version used is 2.8.1 stable version.
User can view a list of top headlines in this app. Also there is an option to view headlines as categories. Whenever user clicks a category, app shows main headlines regarding those category.
